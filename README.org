* Funnel Metadynamics
This project aims to calculate the binding free energy ddiffernce by running MD simulations
using an enganced sampling protocol called ~Funnel Metadynamics~.
This project aims to calculate the binding free energy difference by running MD simulations
using an enhanced sampling protocol called ~Funnel Metadynamics~.
The funnel metadynamics defines a funnel-shaped restraint that enhances
the sampling of the ligand binding sites and its unbinding states.This method has been introduced in
a paper titled "Funnel metadynamics as accurate binding free-energy method," and a new Funnel
protocol explained in "Combining Machine Learning and Enhanced Sampling Techniques for Efficient and
Accurate Calculation of Absolute Binding Free Energies"
